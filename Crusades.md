The Crusades were a series of religious wars initiated, supported, and sometimes directed by the Christian Latin Church in [[Medieval Europe]]. The best known of these military expeditions are those to the [[Holy Land]] in the period between 1095 and 1291 that were intended to conquer [[Jerusalem]] and its surrounding area from [[Islam|Muslim]] rule. Beginning with the [[First Crusade]], which resulted in the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099, dozens of military campaigns were organized, providing a focal point of European history for centuries. Crusading declined rapidly after the 15th century.
## Each Crusade
### First Crusade
Four armies of Crusaders were formed from troops of different Western European regions, led by [[Raymond of Saint-Gilles]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[Hugh of Vermandois]] and [[Bohemond of Taranto]] (with his nephew [[Tancred]]). These groups departed for [[Byzantium]] in August 1096.

A less organized band of knights and commoners known as the “[[People’s Crusade]]” set off before the others under the command of a popular preacher known as [[Peter the Hermit]].

Ignoring [[Alexius]]’ advice to wait for the rest of the Crusaders, Peter’s army crossed the [[Bosporus]] Strait in early August. In the first major clash between the Crusaders and Muslims, [[Turkey|Turkish]] forces crushed the invading Europeans at Cibotus.

Another group of Crusaders, led by the notorious [[Count Emicho]], carried out a series of massacres of [[Judaism|Jews]] in various towns in the [[Rhineland]] in 1096, drawing widespread outrage and causing a major crisis in Jewish-[[Christianity|Christian]] relations.

When the four main armies of Crusaders arrived in [[Constantinople]], Alexius insisted that their leaders swear an oath of loyalty to him and recognize his authority over any land regained from the Turks, as well as any other territory they might conquer. All but Bohemond resisted taking the oath.

In May 1097, the Crusaders and their Byzantine allies attacked Nicea (now Iznik, Turkey), the Seljuk capital in Anatolia. The city surrendered in late June.
