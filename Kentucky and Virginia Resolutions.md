The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions were political statements drafted in 1798 and 1799 in which the [[Kentucky]] and [[Virginia]] legislatures took the position that the federal [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] were unconstitutional. The resolutions argued that the states had the right and the duty to declare unconstitutional those acts of [[congress]] that the [[Constitution]] did not authorize. In doing so, they argued for states' rights and strict construction of the Constitution. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions were written secretly by Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]] respectively.
