#Math 
An exponential function is a type of function which grows exponentially, rather than [[Line|linearly]] or [[Quadratic Function|quadratically]], etc. Exponential functions obey the [[exponent rules]].

>[!Definition]
>Let $a$ be a positive real number other than 1. The function
>$$f(x)=a^x$$
>is the exponential function with base a.
# The number $e$
Many natural, physics, and economic phenomena are best modeled by an exponential function whose base is the famous number $e$, which is 2.718281828 to nine decimal places. We can define $e$ to be the number that the function $f(x) = \left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^x$ approaches as $x$ approaches infinity. The exponential functions $y=e^x$ and $y=e^{-x}$ are frequently used as models of exponential growth of decay. For example, interest compounded continuously uses the model $y=P\cdot e^{rt}$, where $P$ is the initial investment, $r$ is the interest rate as a decimal, and $t$ is time in years.
