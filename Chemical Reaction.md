A chemical reaction is the process by which one or more substances are changed into one or more different substances

Original substances $\to$ Resulting substances
(reactants)                    (products)

Chemical reactions must obey the law of conservation of mass:
$$m_{products}=m_{reactants}$$
Chemical equations represent identities and relative molecular or molar amounts of the reactants and products in a chemical reaction.
## Indications of a Chemical Reaction
- Energy released as heat
- Production of a gas
- Formation of a precipitate
	- Solid produced as a result of a chemical reaction in solution and that separates from the solution
- Color Change
- Odor Change
## Characteristics of a Chemical Equation
1. Equation must represent known facts
2. Must contain correct formulas for reactants and products
3. Law of conservation of mass must be satisfied
**coefficient**: small whole number that appears in from of a formula in a chemical equation
### Symbols
- $\to$ "Yields" one direction
- $\rightleftarrows$ reversible reaction
- $(s)$ solid state
- $(l)$ liquid state
- $(aq)$ dissolved in water (aqueous)
- $(g)$ gaseous state
- $\xrightarrow{\Delta}$ or $\xrightarrow{heat}$ reactions heated
- $\xrightarrow{pressure}$ pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure
- $\xrightarrow{MnO_2}$ formula of catalyst
### Skeleton Equations
Skeleton Equations are chemical equations without coefficients
Examples:
$$Na_2O_{(s)}+H_2O_{(l)}\to NaOH_{(aq)}$$
$$BaCl_{2(aq)}+Na_2Cr_{4(aq)}\to BaCrO_{4(s)}+NaCl_{(aq)}$$
