Laissez-Faire [[Capitalism]] is a economic theory which consists of an unregulated market economy with near infinite expansions and monopolies. The most notable example of Laissez-Fair is in the [[United States|American]] [[Gilded Age]], where companies in multiple industries grew increasingly large, and workers were treated horribly.
