Insulators are materials whose outer [[Electron]]s are tightly bound to their [[nuclei|Nucleus]]. Modest electric [[Force]]s are not able to pull these electrons free. When an electric force is applied, the electron clouds around the atom stretch and deform in response to the force, but the electrons do not depart. Glass, plastic, stone and air are insulators. Even for insulators, though, electric force can always be turned up high enough to rip electrons away-this is called breakdown. That's what is happening to air [[Molecule]]s when you see a spark.
