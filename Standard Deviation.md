The standard deviation is the average distance of all data points from the [[Mean]].
$S_x$ = standard deviation
$\sigma_x$ = population standard deviation
$$S_x=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$$
## $S_x$
can only use when:
- using mean as measure of center
- distribution is [[Unimodal]] and symmetric
$S_x=0$ means no spread
- always going to be $S_x\ge0$
$S_x$ is **not** resistant to [[Outlier]]s
- even more sensitive to extreme values than $\bar{x}$
