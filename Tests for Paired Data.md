**Paired Data**: two observations (like matched pairs)
One sample t-test  for paired data: compare data by analyzing mean difference $\mu_d$
- Take difference within each pair to produce a single sample first
- Test [[Statistic]]:
	- $t=\frac{\displaystyle\bar{x}_d-\mu_0}{\displaystyle\frac{S_d}{\sqrt{n}}}$
- [[Confidence Interval]]:
	- $\displaystyle\bar{x}_d\pm t^*\frac{S_d}{\sqrt{n}}$
- $\mu_0$ is the true mean of differences (almost always 0)
- $\bar{x}_d$ is sample mean of differences
