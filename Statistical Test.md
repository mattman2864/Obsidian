A statistical test is a formal procedure for comparing observed data with a hypothesis. The goal is to assess evidence provided by data about some claim concerning a [[Population]]. In a statistical test, the evidence is weighed against a claim. An outcome that would rarely happen if a claim were true is good evidence that the claim is not true.
## Hypothesis
### Null Hypothesis ($H_o$)
Statement of no difference $-$ base case
### Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)
The claim about the population that we are trying to find evidence for.
- Always about a parameter
- Need to state $H_a$ before testing to avoid bias
- One-sided (one-tailed)
	- We are only interested in $p$ being $>$ or $<$ a specific value
- Two-sided (two-tailed)
	- We are interested in $p$ being $\ne$ a specific value
## $P$-value
The probability, assuming $H_o$ is true, that the statistic would be as extreme or more extreme than the one actually observed
- Small $P$-value means evidence against $H_o$
	- Means that the observed result is unlikely to occur when $H_o$ is true
## Significance Level
Significance level $\alpha$ is a fixed level we regard as decisive
- $P$-value $<\infty\to$ reject $H_o\to$ conclude $H_a$ (in context)
- $P$-value $\ge<\infty\to$ fail to reject $H_o\to$ cannot conclude $H_a$
$\alpha=0.5$ is most commonly used significance level
Be sure to state $\alpha$ before the data are produced
Your conclusion must include:
- Compare $P$-value to $\alpha$
- Make a decision about $H_o$
- Explain what the decision means
