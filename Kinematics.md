#Physics 
Kinematics is the study of motion without looking into the cause of motion. It is the study of [[position]], [[displacement]], time, [[velocity]], speed, and [[Acceleration]]. Equations and graphs are vital tools in kinematics.

When an object moves, its **position** relative to a point of reference changes with time. The rate at which position changes is the **velocity** of the object. If the velocity of an object changes, it is said to accelerate. The rate at which velocity changes is called **acceleration**. Velocity and  acceleration are [[vector]] quantities with both magnitude and direction. **Speed** is a [[Scalar]] quantity which is the rate of motion without direction. **Displacement** is a vector quantity defined as the change of position. Therefore, velocity is displacement divided by time.

To find the **average velocity** divide the change in position, displacement, by the elapsed time. **Average acceleration** is the change in velocity divided by the elapsed time. **Average speed** is the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time.

With [[calculus]], rates can be found by taking the [[derivative]]. For example, if the position of an object is given as the function:
$$x(t)=3t^2-5t+7$$
Taking the first derivative with respect to time would give the function for the velocity of the object:
$$v(t)=6t-5$$
Taking the derivative of the velocity function gives the acceleration function:
$$a(t)=6$$
When looking at kinematic graphs this pattern can also be seen. The slope of the $x$-$t$ graph predicts the velocity graph and the slops of the velocity graph predicts the acceleration.

The [[Slope]] of the position-time graph is the velocity. The quadratic position-time graph becomes a linear velocity-time graph with a constant positive slope.  If the position-time graph is concave up, the acceleration is positive.  If the position-time graph is concave down, the acceleration is negative.  The slope of a velocity-time graph is the acceleration.
## Multi-Dimensional
When analyzing motion of more than one dimension, the position, velocity,  and acceleration must be broken down into perpendicular components. Parallel components are combined and then the components can be recombined to give the magnitude and direction of the resultant.

If the vector in the diagram represents the velocity $v$ of an object at a point in time, it would be broken into components $v_x$ and $v_y$:
$$v_x=v\cos\phi$$
$$v_y=v\sin\phi$$
And given $v_x$ and $v_y$, the magnitude of the resultant vector $v$ and angle $\phi$ could be found using:
$$v=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}$$
$$\phi=\tan^{-1}\frac{v_y}{v_x}$$
Alternatively, if the motion is in multiple dimensions, the position, velocity, and acceleration functions may be given in vector notation such as:
$$\vec{r}=A\hat{i}+B\hat{j}+C\hat{k}$$
...for a three-dimensional position vector. Velocity and acceleration vectors may be written in a similar notation. In this format, the components are clearly visible and easy to add, subtract, multiply, or divide, and the magnitude and direction can be determined as shown above.
