The Spanish Inquisition is the forced conversion/expulsion of all non-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] religions, such as [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. Many Jews, known as *Conversos*, were forced to convert to Catholicism in order to avoid prosecution. The Spanish Inquisition was created in the pursuit of religious unity in [[Spain]] and all Spanish colonies. This resulted in the [[Sephardic Jews]], which is Jews who were forced out of the country and to migrate to other European countries.
