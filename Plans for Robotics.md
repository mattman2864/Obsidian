# Before Next Season
## Offseason Event
### Ideas for game
- 1v1s
- blindfold
- stealing
### Fundraising
- concessions
- donations
- sign-up fee
## Learn
- Get familiar with CAD
	- build practice parts
	- use a single tool - OnShape recommended
- Programmers learn basic control theory
	- FSM
	- PID
	- [Crtl Alt FTC](https://www.ctrlaltftc.com)
- Programmers learn git *well*
	- branching
	- merging
	- pull requests
	- commits
	- pushes
	- etc
- Look into possible fundraising opportunities
	- waffle bake sale
	- cold email/call
	- presentations
	- reaching out to friends and family
- Watch videos
	- **TODO: add video watchlist**
# New Techniques/Approaches
## Development Process
1. Sketch
	- draw out plan on paper for a general approach
	- get inspired by "robot in x hours/days" videos or successful robots from previous seasons with similar goals
	- Occam's Razor - "The simplest solution is often the best"
2. Prototype
	- Model the part in CAD using an assembly of 3D printed parts and goBilda parts
	- If everything seems alright, build a minimum functioning prototype and test
	- are there any changes that need to be made? if so then return to sketch/modeling phase
3. Testing
	- Extensive testing should be put in place to ensure the part is the best it possibly can be
	- If changed need to be made, return to sketch/prototype
4. Construction
	- Build a high-quality version with intended use on the final robot. This should not be changed except in a dire case such as breakage
## Software
- Utilize modularity cleanly but not excessively
- Utilize control theory concepts
- Utilize Git when necessary for collaboration
## Driving
- Lots of driving practice
- Finalize robot at least a week before competitions in order to give time for driver practice
- Use different scenarios and challenges such as a part breaking or another robot getting in the way
	- do not tell the drivers beforehand - learn to adapt to different situations
- Don't be afraid of using 2 drivers
