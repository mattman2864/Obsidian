# New Techniques/Approaches
## Development Process
1. Sketch
	- draw out plan on paper for a general approach
	- get inspired by "robot in x hours/days" videos or successful robots from previous seasons with similar goals
	- Occam's Razor - "The simplest solution is often the best"
2. Prototype
	- Model the part in CAD using an assembly of 3D printed parts and goBilda parts
	- If everything seems alright, build a minimum functioning prototype and test
	- are there any changes that need to be made? if so then return to sketch/modeling phase
3. Construction
	- Build a high-quality
