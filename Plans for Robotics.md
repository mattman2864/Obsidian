first things first
***BE PRESENT***
***BE ON TIME***
***BE FOCUSED AND INVOLVED***
I believe that if we do these things and the things I list below, we can be competitive with the top teams in the state and even the world.
# Before Next Season
## Offseason Event
### Ideas for game
- 1v1s
- blindfold
- stealing
### Fundraising
- concessions
- donations
- sign-up fee
## Learn
- Online Resources
	- [Game Manual Zero](https://www.gm0.net/)
		- Good place to start for all general topics related to ftc, from outreach and fundraising to manufacturing to control theory to team management
	- [Crtl Alt FTC](https://www.ctrlaltftc.com) 
		- Best resource for control theory for FTC, has lots of artl
- Get familiar with CAD
	- build practice parts
	- use a single tool - OnShape recommended
	- learn how to do assemblies with custom parts and gobilda parts
- Programmers learn basic control theory
	- FSM
	- PID
	- [Crtl Alt FTC](https://www.ctrlaltftc.com) is a great resource for these topics
- Programmers learn git *well*
	- branching
	- merging
	- pull requests
	- commits
	- pushes
- Look into possible fundraising opportunities
	- waffle bake sale
	- cold email/call
	- presentations
	- reaching out to friends and family
- Watch videos
	- **TODO: add video watchlist**
# During the Season
## Development Process
1. Sketch
	- draw out plan on paper for a general approach
	- get inspired by "robot in x hours/days" videos or successful robots from previous seasons with similar goals
	- Occam's Razor - "The simplest solution is often the best"
2. Prototype
	- Model the part in CAD using an assembly of 3D printed parts and goBilda parts
		- We should try to model as much of the robot as possible. Lots of time reprinting parts could be saved if we just made sure the part fit in the assembly.
	- If everything seems alright, build a minimum functioning prototype and test
	- are there any changes that need to be made? if so then return to sketch/modeling phase
3. Testing
	- Extensive testing should be put in place to ensure the part is the best it possibly can be
	- If changed need to be made, return to sketch/prototype
4. Construction
	- Build a high-quality version with intended use on the final robot. This should not be changed except in a dire case such as breakage
## Design
- Use yellow ABS for printed parts
- see if we can machine aluminum for things like arms and drive train
- use fancy servos in important places like claws and arms
	- the minis might be worth a try in some scenarios. They are much smaller and lighter, and so would work well as a claw on the end of an arm.
- use belts on motors if possible to prevent breakage
- 
## Software
- Utilize modularity cleanly but not excessively
- Utilize control theory concepts
- Utilize Git when necessary for collaboration
## Driving
- Lots of driving practice
	- Use our own field if possible, if not then the MESH is fine
- Finalize robot at least a week before competitions in order to give time for driver practice
- Use different scenarios and challenges such as a part breaking or another robot getting in the way
	- do not tell the drivers beforehand - learn to adapt to different situations
- Don't be afraid of using 2 drivers
## Time Management
- Programming can begin *before* construction, if a basic plan is created. appropriate adjustments in the program can be made as the physical robot changes
- Robot should be given to programmers at a certain point to complete autos (depends how long autos take)
- If first competition is in December, get autos in a basic workable state, otherwise use winter break to make autos get extra points (i.e. cycling in auto/scoring extra game elements)
- We should start with meeting 3 times a week for 2-3 hours
	- adjustments can be made later in the season as we get closer to competition if we need more/less time
## Outreach
- Although we do some outreach during the season, and that is okay, we should absolutely not prioritize outreach over work on the robot. Other teams are simply very very good at outreach, and there is no chance for us to even be considered.
- We have not won even 3rd place for any award that considers outreach, we are far from those teams
- Outreach should only be for
	- low-effort events such as a couple hours one night
	- fundraising
