A stack is a [[Data Structure]] where items are placed on top and removed from top (i.e. **LIFO**: Last In, First Out).
## Stack Operations
`push`: add item to top of stack
`pop`: remove and return top item
`size`: return size of stack
`peek`: return top item in stack
## Stack Applications
Stacks are used to undo/redo commands. They are used for backtracking.
