#APUSH 
[[Harry Truman]] "inherited" the problem - and decision - upon taking the presidency
Options:
1. Mass invasion of [[Japan]]
	1. Considered not a viable option due to guaranteed mass casualties
2. Naval blockade - starve out Japan
	1. Japan's strategy was to fight to the death and refuse surrender. This option would continue to draw out the war, costing lives and mass amounts of money
3. Softening of wanting unconditional surrender from Japan
	1. An option, but wouldn't guarantee a prevention of further war
4. Drop an atomic bomb near Japan to display US power
	1. Considered the best option long term
	2. Promoted by [[Robert Oppenheimer]]
