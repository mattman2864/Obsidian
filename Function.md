A function from a [[set]] $D$ to a set $R$ is a rule that assigns a unique element in $R$ to each element in $D$. In other words, a function takes an input variable and returns an output variable. The inputs make up the **domain** of the function; the outputs make up the **range**. For each element in the domain $D$, the function must only return a single output in the set $R$. A function that returns two or more outputs for a given input is *not a function*.
