A constant is a non-varying value. In mathematics, this generally means any real or complex number, such as $1$, $0$, $-2$, $0.4$, $\pi$, $e$, $i$, $\sqrt{2}$, etc. Infinity $\infty$ is not a constant, as its value does not change when it is added to or subtracted from.

In computer science, a constant is defined as a fixed value, usually assigned to an all-caps name.
