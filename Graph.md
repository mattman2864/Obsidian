Graphs are a [[Data Structure]] where nodes are connected in a web of edges. There are two types of graphs: [[Undirected Graph]]s and [[Directed Graph]]s. Undirected graphs have no specific direction, while directed graphs have a specific direction for each edge.
## Terminology
- [[Path]]: from $a$ to $b$ on [[Directed Graph]]s
	- Closed Path: a loop of directed edges
	- Simple Path: path where nodes are not repeated
- Loop: An edge that connects a vertex to itself
- Degree of node: Number of edges connecting a node to graph
