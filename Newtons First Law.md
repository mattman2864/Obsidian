Newton's first law of motion states that
> Every body persists in its state of being at rest or moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.

Or, as commonly put, "An object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by a force."

Newton's first law is a fundamental law in [[Kinematics]] and [[Physics]].
