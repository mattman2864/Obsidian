#APUSH 
 As Allied armies advanced in 1944, Nazis abandoned camps - either killed or marched prisoners to camps closer to Germany
- In 1944, FDR created the War Refugee Board to try to help people threatened by Nazis, saving about 200,000 lives
- 1945 - American troops discover Mauthausen camp
- In liberating camps, troops helped bury dead, comfort survivors with food, clothing & medical assistance
