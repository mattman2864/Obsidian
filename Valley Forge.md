Valley Forge functioned as the third of eight winter encampments for the [[Continental Army]]'s main body, commanded by [[George Washington]] during the [[American Revolution]]. In 1777, Congress fled [[Philadelphia]] to escape the [[Britain|British]] capture of the city. After failing to retake Philadelphia, Washington led his 12,000-man army 18 miles northwest of Philadelphia. They remained there for six months, from December 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778. At Valley Forge, the [[Continental Army]] struggled to manage a disastrous supply crisis while retraining and reorganizing their units. About 1,700 to 2,000 soldiers died from disease, possibly exacerbated by malnutrition.
