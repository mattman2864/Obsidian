The Articles of Confederation was a written agreement between the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that served as the nation's first frame of government. It had an emphasis on decreased federal power and made taxing practically impossible. It had many problems, most notably the lack of federal power, and was replaced by the [[Constitution]] in 1789.
