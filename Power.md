Power is defined as the rate [[Energy]] ($U$) is transformed over time. We measure power in units of joules/second, also known as *watts*.

($1\;watt=1\;joule/second)$

$\displaystyle power = \frac{dU}{dt}$

An electric current is capable of transferring power. Current is the rate of flow of charge, and voltage measures the energy transferred per unit of charge. We can insert these definitions into the equation for power:

$\displaystyle power=\frac{dU}{dt}=\frac{dU}{dq}\times\frac{dq}{dt}=vi$

Electrical power is the product of voltage times current in units of watts.
