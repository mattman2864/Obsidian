Power is defined as the rate energy ($U$) is transformed over time. We measure power in units of joules/second, also known as *watts*.

($1\;watt=1\;joule/second)$

$power = \frac{dU}{dt}$

An electric current is capable of transferring power. Current is the rate of flow of charge, and voltage measures the energy transferred per unit of charge. We can insert these
