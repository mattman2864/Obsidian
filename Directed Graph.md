Directed graphs are a type of [[Graph]] where nodes are connected in specific directions. These connections are called **edges** or **arcs**. The arcs can be unidirectional or bidirectional, meaning that they can lead to one point with no way to go back, or that they can travel in both directions freely.
# Definition
A directed graph can be defined by the ordered pair $G = (V, A)$
- $V$  is a set of nodes
- $A$  is a set of ordered pairs between nodes, called edges.
