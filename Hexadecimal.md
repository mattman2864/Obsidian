Hexadecimal is a number system with base 16. It most commonly uses letters to represent the decimal numbers 10-15, as shown:

| Decimal Number | Hexadecimal Digit |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 0              | 0                 |
| 1              | 1                 |
| 2              | 2                 |
| 3              | 3                 |
| 4              | 4                  |
| 5              | 5                 |
| 6              | 6                 |
| 7              | 7                 |
| 8              | 8                 |
| 9              | 9                 |
| 10             | a                 |
| 11             | b                 |
| 12             | c                 |
| 13             | d                 |
| 14             | e                 |
| 15             | f                  |
Numbers above 15, for example, 35, are represented by the number of 16s in the 16s place, and the number of leftover 1s in the 1s place, so for 35, this would be represented as 23, because $(2\times16)+(3\times1)=35$.

In computer memory, the address of a byte of memory is denoted by a hexadecimal number preceded by `0x`, for example, `0x23`.
