#APUSH
The Kellogg-Briand Pact was an agreement to "outlaw" war in an attempt to prevent another World War. However, it did not have much impact in stopping the rising militarism of the 1930s, the rise in fascism in [[Germany]] or [[Italy]], or [[World War II]]. It was initially proposed by [[France]] to the [[United States]], but President [[Calvin Coolidge]] was hesitant to sign it based on the fear that it would force the US to be involved if France was invaded. He signed it only after multiple other countries agreed to sign it. It was massively popular internationally in [[Europe]].
