# War Bonds and Stamps
War bonds are purchased to help fund the war effort, and investors would later make money after the war.

People could buy the bond at $18, and later get $25 back. War Stamps were a "mini" bond to appeal to kids and those with less disposable income. 18 stamps could be turned into a bond. This created a general rise in stamp collecting. These were publicized everywhere - newspaper cartoons, posters, ads, etc.
# Rationing
Anything needed for the war effort was rationed, meaning you needed a "coupon" to cash in to purchase the item. Food, tires, gas, and clothing/fabric were rationed. Sugar was the first to be rationed - main producers were the [[Philippines]] and [[Hawaii]], both of which were now affected by the war. The average American was limited to 4 gallons of gas per week. People were limited to two pairs of shoes per year in 1945.
## Victory Gardens
U.S. was working to feed its increased military forces, Allied soldiers, and Axis POWs, causing limited food availability. Victory Gardens became a way for the public to support the war effort AND increase their personal food supply. In 1945, ~20 million gardens were in use and produced about 40% of all vegetables consumed in the United States.
## Black Market
Due to rationing, black market purchases became common (especially tires!). Extra ration books or stockpiled materials from before the war were used in the black market. Propaganda pushed that black market sellers & buyers were not patriotic and personally supporting the Axis Powers/Hitler by “stealing” needed supplies.
## Blackouts
While not as common as in [[Europe]], blackouts were often practiced on the west and east coast. The goal was to prevent light or communication signals to make it harder for U-boats or bombs to find their targets. Volunteers making up the Civilian Defense checked homes and enforced blackouts, possibly issuing fines or prison. No light could be emitting from the home - rise in blackout curtains, though cardboard/scrap was more common due to lack of fabric from rationing. This grew in as a conservation measure to better support production efforts. MLB and minor league baseball will only play during the day to prevent need for lights at night.
