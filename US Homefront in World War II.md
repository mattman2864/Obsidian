# War Bonds and Stamps
War bonds are purchased to help fund the war effort, and investors would later make money after the war.
## Examples
### US in World War II
People could buy the bond at $18, and later get $25 back. War Stamps were a "mini" bond to appeal to kids and those with less disposable income. 18 stamps could be turned into a bond. This created a general rise in stamp collecting. These were publicized everywhere - newspaper cartoons, posters, ads, etc.
