# Failed New Monarchs
## [[Poland]]
[[Poland]] failed during the New Monarch movement due to the limited power of the central government, the increased power of [[Nobles]], and their inability to centralize. The Polish [[Diet]] prevented organization. Due to this, Poland's government was referred to as "Polish [[Anarchism|Anarchy]]". In order to make a decision, everyone in the [[Diet]] had to agree to it unanimously, meaning that a single *liberum veto* ("I do not allow" in [[English]]) would prevent a decision from being made.

## [[Holy Roman Empire]]
The HRE failed to centralize due to the Golden Bull decree, which limited the power of emperor [[Charles IV]], and was intended to eliminate [[Catholic Church|Papal]] interference in German political affairs and to recognize the importance of the princes, especially the **electors**, of the empire.
