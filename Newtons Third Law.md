[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s third law states that if object $A$ exerts a [[force]] on object $B$, then object $B$ must exert a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction back on object $A$.

This law represents a certain symmetry in nature: forces always occur in pairs, and one body cannot exert a force on another without experiencing a force itself. We sometimes refer to this law loosely as action-reaction, where the force exerted is the action and the force experienced as a consequence is the reaction.
