*Common Sense* was a 47 page pamphlet written by [[Thomas Paine]] in 1775-1776 advocating for independence from [[Britain]] to people in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Paine collected various moral and political arguments to encourage common people in the Colonies to fight for egalitarian government. It was published anonymously on January 10, 1776, at the beginning of the [[American Revolution]] and became an immediate sensation.
