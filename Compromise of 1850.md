The compromise of 1850 is a group of five laws passed in September of 1850. These laws made concessions to both free and slave states
# The Texas Provision
[[Texas]], a slave state, had claimed lands all the way to Santa Fe, [[New Mexico]], as well as lands north of the [[Missouri Compromise]] line. As part of the Compromise of 1850, Texas relinquished these disputed territories in exchange for $10 million to help pay off its debts to [[Mexico]].
# The California Provision
In 1849, [[California]] had requested to enter the union as a free state. The South contested this, as it would upset the balance between free and slave states. At part of the 1850 compromise, California was allowed to enter as a free state.
# The New Mexico and Utah Provision
In exchange for California's free status, the federal government agreed to place no restrictions on slavery in the [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]] territories. Instead, the territories would be ruled by popular sovereignty, allowing residents of the territories to decide the issue when they applied for statehood.
# The District of Columbia Provision
