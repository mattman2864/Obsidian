The compromise of 1850 is a group of five laws passed in September of 1850. These laws made concessions to both free and slave states
# The Texas Provision
[[Texas]], a slave state, had claimed lands all the way to Santa Fe, [[New Mexico]], as well as lands north of the [[Missouri Compromise]] line. As part of the Compromise of 1850, Texas relinquished these disputed territories in exchange for $10 million to help pay off its debts to [[Mexico]].
# The California Provision
In 1849, [[California]] had requested to enter the union as a free state. The South contested this, as it would upset the balance between free and slave states. At part of the 1850 compromise, California was allowed to enter as a free state.
# The New Mexico and Utah Provision
In exchange for California's free status, the federal government agreed to place no restrictions on slavery in the [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]] territories. Instead, the territories would be ruled by popular sovereignty, allowing residents of the territories to decide the issue when they applied for statehood.
# The District of Columbia Provision
[[Washington D.C.]] claimed the largest slave market in [[North America]]. To appease slave owners, the practice of slavery would continue to be permitted.
# The Fugitive Slave Law
The most contentious provision was the Fugitive Slave Act. This law required citizens nationwide to aid in the recovery and return of fugitive slaves.
# Important Years to Note
- 1848: The [[Treaty of Hidalgo]] ends the [[Mexican-American War]]
- 1849: [[California]] enters the union as a free state.
- 1850: The five provisions of the compromise are entered into law.
# Why is it important?
After the [[Mexican-American War]], tensions between the North and South reached a fever pitch. Civil war seemed inevitable. Both sides felt betrayed by the federal government, and the issue of slavery was no longer just an issue of economics, but one of states' rights and morality. Something had to be done to preserve the union. Although it left both sides unsatisfied, the Compromise of 1850 succeeded, for a long time, in keeping the nation intact and staying off a civil war for another ten years.
