Since each output of a one-to-one [[function]] comes from just one input, a [[one-to-one function]] can be reversed to send outputs back to the inputs from which they came. The function defined by reversing a one-to-one function $f$ is the **inverse of $f$**. The symbol for inverse of $f$ is $f^{-1}$, read "$f$ inverse." The $-1$ in $f^{-1}$ is not an exponent; $f^{-1}(x)$ does not mean $1/f(x)$.

Composing a function with its inverse in either order sends each output back to the input from which it came. In other words, the results of composing a function and its inverse in either order is the **identity function**, the function that assigns each number to itself. This gives a way to test whether two functions $f$ and $g$ are inverses of one another. Compute $f\circ g$ and $g\circ f$. If $(f\circ g)(x) = (g\circ f)(x) = x$, then $f$ and $g$ are inverses of one another; otherwise they are not. The functions $f(x)=x^3$ and $g(x)=x^{1/3}$ are inverses of one another because $(x^3)^{1/3}=x$ and $(x^{1/3})^3=x$ for every number $x$.
