A data type, often shortened to `bool`, that represents one of two values, where it be `1` or `0`, `true` or `false`, `on` or `off`, etc. It is used in low-level hardware architecture in transistors, and also in higher-level programs as a data type. Boolean values can be used in combination to make [[Binary|binary]] numbers. Boolean values can be inputs and outputs of [[Boolean Operator|boolean operators]].
