A linked list is a [[Data Structure]] consisting of a linear collection of items where each item points to the next element in memory. It is different from an [[Array]] because the values are not stored sequentially, and elements can be inserted and removed. Each [[Node]] contains a value and a pointer:

## Linked List vs Array
Linked lists are faster than arrays but use more memory:

|            | Array  | LL  |
| ---------- | ------ | --- |
| **Ram**        | 1x     | >2x |
| **Complexity** | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$    |
