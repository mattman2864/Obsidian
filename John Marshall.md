Ironically, the [[Federalists|Federalist]] judge who caused [[Thomas Jefferson]] the most grief was one of his own cousins from [[Virginia]], John Marshall. Marshall had been appointed chief justice of the [[Supreme Court]] during the final months of the presidency of [[John Adams]]. He held his post for 34 years, during which time he exerted as strong an influence on the Supreme Court as [[George Washington]] had exerted on the presidency. Even when justices appointed by [[Democratic-Republican]] presidents formed a majority on the Court, they often sided with Marshall because they were persuaded that the U.S. [[Constitution]] had created a federal government with strong and flexible powers.
