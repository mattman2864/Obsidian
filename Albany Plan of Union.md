The Albany Plan of Union was a rejected plan to create a unified government for the [[Thirteen Colonies]] at the [[Albany Congress]] on July 10, 1754 in Albany, New York. This was the first notable instance of an attempt to unify the colonies. The plan was suggested by [[Benjamin Franklin]], then a senior leader (age 48) and a delegate from [[Pennsylvania]]. It called for a confederation of colonies to defend against attacks by European and native foes. Rejected by the colonial assemblies due to concern over the central consolidation of power, and by the [[Britain|British]] government because they felt it allowed for too much colonial independence.
