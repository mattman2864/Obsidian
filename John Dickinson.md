#APUSH 
John Dickinson was one of the [[Founding Fathers]] from [[Pennsylvania]]. He wrote a series of essays called "Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania," which rekindled interest in the issue of taxation without representation during the [[Townshend Act]]. He oversaw the drafting of the [[Articles of Confederation]].
