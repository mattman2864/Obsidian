#Physics 
A [[force]] is a push or a pull, and the net force ($\Sigma F$ or $F_{NET}$) is the total force$-$or sum of the forces$-$exerted on an object. Adding [[vector]]s is slightly different from adding regular numbers. When adding vectors, the direction must be taken into account. The net force is the *vector sum* of all the forces exerted on an object.

For instance, consider the two forces of magnitude 30N and 20N that are exerted to the right and left respectively on the object shown above. If rightward is the positive direction, the net force can be found by:
$$\Sigma F=30\;\text{N}-20\;\text{N}$$
$$\Sigma F=10\;\text{N to the right}$$
If there were more horizontal forces, the net force could be found by adding up every force to the right and subtracting every force to the left.
