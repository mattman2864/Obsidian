The derivative is the slope of the tangent line of a function. It is a fundamental part of Calculus, and was first theorized by [[Pierre de Fermat]], though was more formally defined by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

>[!definition]
>The formal definition of the derivative is:
>$$f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
>The alternate definition of the derivative is:
>$$f'(c)=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}$$

# Notation
The derivative of a function can be notated two ways:

| function       | $'$ (Lagrange) | $\frac{d}{dx}$ (Leibniz) |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| $f(x)$ | $f'(x)$        | $\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]$     |
| $y$    | $y'$            | $\frac{dy}{dx}$          |

Both of these notations are commonly used and acceptable.
