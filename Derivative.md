The derivative is the slope of the tangent line of a function. It is a fundamental part of Calculus, and was first discovered by [[Pierre de Fermat]], though the more commonly used definition of the limit was discovered by both [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].
## Definition of a Derivative
The formal definition of the derivative is:
$$f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
The alternate definition of the derivative is:
$$f'(c)=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}$$
