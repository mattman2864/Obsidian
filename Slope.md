Each nonvertical [[Line]] has a *slope*, which we can calculate from [[Increments]] in coordinates.

Let $L$ be a nonvertical line in the plane and $P_1(x_1,y_1)$ and $P_2(x_2,y_2)$ two points on $L$.

We call $\Delta y=y_2-y_1$ the **rise** from $P_1$ to $P_2$ and $\Delta x=x_2-x_1$ the **run** from $P_1$ to $P_2$. Since $L$ is not vertical, $\Delta x\ne0$ and we define the slope of $L$ to be the amount of rise per unit of run. It is conventional to denote the slope by the letter $m$.

A [[Line]] that goes uphill as $x$ increases has a positive slope. A line that goes downhill as $x$ increases has a negative slope. A horizontal line has slope zero since all of its points have the same y-coordinate, making $\Delta y=0$. For vertical lines, $\Delta x=0$ and the ratio $\Delta y/\Delta x$ is undefined. We express this by saying that vertical lines *have no slope*.

Let $P_!(x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2(x_2,y_2)$ be points on a nonvertical line, $L$. The **slope** of $L$ is
$$m=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
