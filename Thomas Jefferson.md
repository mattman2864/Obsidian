### Judicial Impeachments
Jefferson sought to overturn past [[Federalists]] measures and appointments. Soon after entering office, he suspended the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] and released those jailed under them. The Federalist appointments to the courts previously made by [[George Washington]] and [[John Adams]] were not subject to recall of removal except by impeachment. Federalist judges therefore continued in office, much to the annoyance of the Democratic-Republican president, Jefferson. Hoping to remove partisan Federalist judges, Jefferson supported a campaign of impeachment. The judge of one federal district was found to be mentally unbalanced. The House voted for his impeachment, and the Senate then voted to remove him. The House also impeached a [[Supreme Court]] justice, [[Samuel Chase]], but the senate acquitted him after finding no evidence of "high crimes".

Except for these two cases, the impeachment campaign was largely a failure, as almost all Federalist judges remained in office. Even so, the threat  of impeachment caused the judges to be more cautious and less partisan in their decisions.
### Reelection
Jefferson won reelection by an overwhelming margin, but he faced greater difficulties due to the split of the [[Democratic-Republicans]] by the [[Tertium Quids]], who accused him of abandoning the party's principles. He also faced struggles due to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in [[Europe]].
