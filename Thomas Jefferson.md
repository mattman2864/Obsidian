### Beginning
Jefferson sought to overturn past [[Federalists]] measures and appointments. Soon after entering office, he suspended the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] and released those jailed under them. The Federalist appointments to the courts previously made by [[George Washington]] and [[John Adams]] were not subject to recall of removal except by impeachment. Federalist judges therefore continued in office, much to the annoyance of the Democratic-Republican president, Jefferson. Hoping to remove partisan Federalist judges, Jefferson supported a campaign of impeachment. The judge of one federal district was found to be mentally unbalanced.
