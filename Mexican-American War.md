#APUSH 
In the spring of 1846, tensions mounted between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]], and the **Mexican-American War** (1846-1848) started, in part, over a border dispute between the two countries. Mexico claimed the Nueces River to Texas's southern border, but the United States insisted the border lay further south at the [[Rio Grande River]].

The Mexican-American war confirmed Texas's southern border at the Rio Grande, indicating the United States victory. The United States also acquired California, New Mexico, and Arizona, as well as parts of Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Wyoming.
