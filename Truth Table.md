#CS 
A table that defines the inputs and outputs for a given [[Boolean Operator|boolean operator]]/[[Logic Gate|logic gate]]. The table can have one or multiple inputs, but typically only has one output.

An example of a truth table for a NAND gate is

| x | y | out |
|:--|:--|:----|
| 0 | 0 |   1 |
| 1 | 0 |   1 |
| 0 | 1 |   1 |
| 1 | 1 |   0 |  

In this example, the inputs `x` and `y` are boolean values of `0` or `1`. The output is also a boolean value.
