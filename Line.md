A line is defined as passing through two fixed points and having a [[Slope]] and a [[#$y$-Intercept|y-intercept]].
## Types of Lines
### Parallel Lines
Parallel lines form equal angles with the x-axis.

Hence, nonvertical parallel lines have the same slope. Conversely, lines with equal slopes form equal angles with the x-axis and are therefore parallel.
### Perpendicular Lines
If two nonvertical lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ are perpendicular, their slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ satisfy $m_1 m_2=-1$, so each slope is the *negative reciprocal* of the other:
$$m_1=-\frac{1}{m_2}\quad m_2=-\frac{1}{m_1}$$
The argument goes like this: In the notation of Figure 1.3, $m_1=\tan\Phi_1=a/h$, while $m_2=\tan\Phi_2=-h/a$. Hence, $m_1m_2=(a/h)(-h/a)=-1$.

## Equations of Lines
The vertical line through the point $(a, b)$ has equation $x=a$ since every $x$-coordinate on the line has the value $a$. Similarly, the horizontal line through the point $(a,b)$ has equation $y=b$.

We can write an equation for any nonvertical line $L$ if we know its slope $m$ and the coordinates of one point $P_1(x_1,y_1)$ on it. if $P(x,y)$ is *any* other point on $L$, then
$$\frac{y-y-1}{x-x_1}=m,$$
so that
$$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\quad or\quad y=m(x-x_1)+y_1$$
### Point-Slope Equation
The equation
$$y=m(x-x_1)+y_1$$
is the **point-slope equation** of the line through the point $(x_1,y_1)$ with slope $m$.
### $y$-Intercept and $x$-intercept
The coordinate of the point where a nonvertical line intersects the $y$-axis is the $y$-intercept of the line. Similarly, the $x$-coordinate of the point where a nonhorizontal line intersects the $x$-axis is the  $x$-intercept of the line. A line with slope $m$ and $y$-intercept $b$ passes through $(0,b)$, so
$y=m(x-0)+b\quad$ or, more simply, $\quad y=mx+b$
### Slope-Intercept Equation
The equation
$$y=mx+b$$
is the **slope-intercept equation** of the line with slope $m$ and $y$-intercept $b$.
### General Linear Equation
If $A$ and $B$ are not both zero, the graph of the equation $Ax+By=C$ is a line. Every line has an equation in this form, even lines with undefined slopes.

The equation
$Ax+By=C$ ($A$ and $B$ not both $0$)
is a **general linear equation** in $x$ and $y$.
