Current is the flow of [[Charge]]. Charge flows in a current. Current is reported as the number of charges per unit time passing through a boundary. Visualize placing a boundary all the way through a wire. Station yourself near the boundary and count the number of charges passing by. Report how much charge passed through the boundary in one second. We assign a *positive* sign to current corresponding to the direction a *positive* charge would be moving.

Since current is the amount of charge passing through a boundary in a fixed amount of time, it can be expressed mathematically using the following equation:
$$i=\frac{dq}{dt}$$
