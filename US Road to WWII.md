#APUSH 
# Economic Policies
Germany was left with lots of debt, and they printed lots of money to pay for it. Hyperinflation resulted, and this caused a major economic depression. Out of this, fascism and ultimately the [[Nazi Party]] rose to power.
# Good Neighbor Policy
# Appeasement
Allied nations would give [[Adolf Hitler]] what he wanted, and let him get away with attacking smaller nations, as a hope that he would stop the aggression. This only made Hitler more powerful, and let multiple countries fall under Nazi control.
