Mercantilism is an economic system based on colonialism and imperialism, and revolves around gaining money from colonies, who send that money to their parent country. In practice, this was usually [[Europe]]an countries with colonies in the [[Americas]]. It was used mainly during the [[Age of Exploration]].

# Creation
Mercantilism was created because of the [[New Monarch]]s needing money to fund their extensive centralized government. **Specie** (bullion) was limited in Europe, so new methods were needed to obtain gold. During this time, [[Protectionism]] was created, such as Tariffs. Official monopolies were created, for example, the [[East India Company]] in the 1600s.
