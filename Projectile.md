Two-dimensional [[kinematics]] includes the topic of **projectiles** $-$ objects moving through the air under the influence of [[gravity]]. Projectiles, ignoring air resistance, follow a [[Parabola|parabolic]] trajectory. The horizontal component of the [[velocity]] will remain constant  while the vertical component [[Acceleration|accelerates]] as in free fall.
