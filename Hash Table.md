A hash table, also called a hash map, dictionary, or associative array, is a [[Data Structure]] where items stored in a list can be accessed with a specific key. Hash Tables always have a [[Algorithmic Complexity|complexity]] of $O(1)$. It uses a **key-value lookup**.
## Hash Table Methods
`set`: sets key to a value
`get`: gets value from key
`delete`: delete key-value pair from table
`size`:
