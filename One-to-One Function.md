A function is a rule that assigns a single value in its range to each point in its domain. Some functions assign the same output to more than one input. For example, $f(x)=x^2$ assigns the output 4 to both 2 and -2. Other functions never output a given value more than once. For example, the cubes of different numbers are always different.

>A function $F(x)$ is **one-to-one** on a domain $D$ if $f(a)\ne f(b)$ whenever $a\ne b$.
