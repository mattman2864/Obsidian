#Calculus 
The chain rule says:
$\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))]=f'(g(x))g'(x)$
it tells us how to [[Derivative|differentiate]] [[Composite Functions]].

# Worked example of applying the chain rule
Differentiate $h(x) = (5-6x)^5$

Notice that $h$ is a composite function: $h(x)=(5-6x)$
inner function: $g(x)=5-6x$
outer function : $f(x)=x^5$
