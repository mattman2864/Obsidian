The Baby Boom was the increase of births in the [[United States]] in the 1950s following the end of [[World War II]]. Over 3.9 million babies were born in 1952 alone. It was caused by the universal rush to early marriage and favorable economic climate for the relatively scarce young men of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] Cohort.
