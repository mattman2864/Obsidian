In uniform [[Circle|circular]] motion, the direction of the velocity changes constantly, so there is always an associated acceleration, even though the speed might be constant.

The figure below shows an object moving in a circular path at constant speed. The direction of the instantaneous velocity is shown at two points along the path. Acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, which points directly toward the center of rotation—the center of the circular path. This direction is shown with the vector diagram in the figure. We call the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion—resulting from a net external force—the centripetal acceleration $a_c$; centripetal means “toward the center” or “center seeking”.

> *The directions of the velocity of an object at two different points, $B$ and $C$, are shown, and the change in velocity $\Delta v$, is seen to point roughly toward the center of curvature. To see what happens instantaneously, the points $B$ and $C$ must be very close and $\Delta\theta$ very small. We'll then find that $\Delta v$ points directly toward the center of curvature.
>Because $a_c=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$, the acceleration is also toward the center. Because $\Delta \theta$ is very small, the arc length $\Delta s$ is equal to the chord length $\Delta r$ for small time differences.*

The direction of centripetal accceleration is toward the center of the circle, but what is its magnitude? Note that the [[triangle]] formed by the velocity vectors and the triangle formed by the radii $r$ and $\Delta s$ are similar. Both the triangles $ABC$ and $PQR$ are isosceles triangles with two equal sides. The two equal sides of the velocity vector tria
