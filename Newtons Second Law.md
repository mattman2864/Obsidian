[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s second law of motion states that there are two variables that directly affect the acceleration of an object. It says that:
$$a=\frac{\Sigma F}{m}$$
Where $a$ is the [[acceleration]] of an object, $\Sigma F$ is the [[net force]] on an object, and $m$ is the [[mass]] of the object.

As shown by the equation, acceleration is proportional to the net force $\Sigma F$, and is inversely proportional to the mass $m$. In other words, if the mass of the object were doubled, the acceleration of the object would be twice as large. Similarly, if the mass of the object were doubled, its acceleration would be half as large.

Since force is a [[vector]], Newton's second law can be written as $\displaystyle\vec{a}=\frac{\Sigma\vec{F}}{m}$. This shows that the direction of the total acceleration vector points in the same direction as the net force vector. In other words, if the net force $\Sigma F$ points right, the acceleration $a$ must point right.
## Using Newton's Second Law
If there are many forces in many directions, it's often easier to analyze each direction independently. In other words, for the horizontal direction we can write
$$a_x=\frac{\Sigma F_x}{m}$$
This shows that the acceleration $a_x$ in the horizontal direction is equal to the net force in the horizontal direction, $\Sigma F_x$, divided by the mass. 

Similarly, for the vertical direction:
$$a_y=\frac{\Sigma F_y}{m}$$
This shows that the acceleration $a_y$ in the horizontal direction is equal to the net force in the horizontal direction, $\Sigma F_y$, divided by the mass. 

>[!Warning]
>A common mistake is to plug a vertical force into a horizontal equation, or vice versa.
