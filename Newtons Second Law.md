[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s second law of motion states that there are two variables that directly affect the acceleration of an object. It says that:
$$a=\frac{\Sigma F}{m}$$
Where $a$ is the [[acceleration]] of an object, $\Sigma F$ is the [[net force]] on an object, and $m$ is the [[mass]] of the object.

As shown by the equation, acceleration is proportional to the net force $\Sigma F$, and is inversely proportional to the mass $m$. In other words, if the mass of the object were doubled, the acceleration of the object would be twice as large. Similarly, if the mass of the object were doubled, its acceleration would be half as large.
