The Republic of Texas was a sovereign state in [[North America]] that existed from March 2, 1836 to February 19, 1846. It shared borders with [[Mexico]], the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], and the [[United States]].
# History
[[Mexico]] won independence from [[Spain]] in 1821. At that time, Mexico's northern provinces included [[California]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]].

When Mexico founded the province of Texas in 1821, the land was very sparsely populated, so Texans actively recruited settlers from the United States to help grow the region's population. Soon, [[Stephen Austin]]—after whom [[Austin]], Texas is named—was selling plots of land to American settlers from a large land grant his father had received from the Mexican government; meanwhile, other settlers from the United States—especially from the American South—were moving to Mexican Texas.

By 1830, there were 7,000 settlers from the United States living in Mexican Texas. But tensions between the Mexican government and settlers from the United States grew as Mexico unsuccessfully attempted to halt further immigration and settlers pushed back against Mexican legal codes. These **regulatory laws** required those living in Mexico—including those living in Texas—to become Mexican, convert to Roman Catholicism, file legal documents in Spanish, and (after Mexico abolished slavery in 1829) end the practice of slavery. In reality, however, Mexico continued to allow settlers from the United States to bring slaves into the territory as "**indentured servants**."

In 1835, settlers form the United States who lived in Texas formed a provisional government, and in 1836 called for independence. In turn, the Mexican government deployed the Mexican leader [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] and his troops into the region in an effort to regain political control.

The settlers in Texas from the United States, together with the active support of [[Tejanos]] (Texans of [[Spain|Spanish]] origin), sought to hold their ground against Santa Anna’s advancing troops.

In March of 1836, following a thirteen day siege, Santa Anna’s 5,000 troops attacked and killed 187 American and Tejano defenders at the battle of the Alamo--a mission-fortress outside San Antonio. Among the dead were Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and commander William Travis. “Remember the Alamo” became, thereafter, a battle cry.
