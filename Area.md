#Math
Area is the measure of a region's size on a surface.
## Areas of Shapes
### [[Square]]
The area of a square is the length of a single side times itself, or $A=s^2$.
### [[Rectangle]]
The area of a rectangle is the length multiplied by the width, or $A = l\times w$.
### [[Circle]]
The area of a circle is pi ($\pi$) times the radius squared, or $A=\pi r^2$.
### [[Triangle]]
The area of a triangle is the altitude times the base times $\frac{1}{2}$, or $A=\frac{a\times h}{2}$.
