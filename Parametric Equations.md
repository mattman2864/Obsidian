A relation is a set of ordered pairs of real numbers. The graph of a relation is the set of points in the plane that correspond to the ordered pairs of the relation. If $x$ and $y$ are [[function]]s of a third variable $t$, called a [[parameter]], then we can use the parametric mode of a grapher to obtain a graph of the relation.
