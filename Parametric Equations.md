A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs of real numbers. The **graph of a relation** is the set of points in the plane that correspond to the ordered pairs of the relation. If $x$ and $y$ are [[function]]s of a third variable $t$, called a [[parameter]], then we can use the parametric mode of a grapher to obtain a graph of the relation.

>If $x$ and $y$ are given as functions
>$$x=f(t),\quad y=g(t)$$
>over an interval of $t$-values, then the set of points $(x, y) = (f(t),\;g(t))$ defined by these equations is a **parametric curve**. The equations are **parametric equations** for the curve.

The variable $t$ is a **parameter** for the curve and its domain $I$ is the **parameter interval**. If $I$ is a closed interval, $a\le t \le b$, the point $(f(a),\;g(a))$ is the **initial point of the curve**, and the point $(f(b),\;g(b))$ is the **terminal point of the curve**. When we give parametric equations and a parameter interval for a curve, we say that we have parameterized the curve. The equations and interval constitute a **parametrization of the curve**.
