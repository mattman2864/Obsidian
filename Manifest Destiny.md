Manifest Destiny was the idea that white Americans were divinely ordained to settle the entire continent of [[North America]]. The ideology of Manifest Destiny inspired a variety of measured designed to remove or destroy the native population. US President [[James Polk]] is the leader most associated with Manifest destiny. It inflamed sectional tensions over slavery, which ultimately led to the Civil War.

The term was first coined by newspaper editor John O'Sullivan to describe the ideology of continental expansionism. Though the term was new, the ideas underlying it were much older, dating back to the first colonial contact between [[Europe|Europeans]] and [[Native Americans]]. The ideology that became known as Manifest Destiny included a belief in the inherent superiority of white Americans, as well as the conviction that they were destined by God to conquer the territories of North America, from sea to shining sea.

The ideology of Manifest Destiny justified extreme measure to clear the native population from the land, including forced removal and violent extermination. For proponents of Manifest Destiny, the American Indians were mere impediments to the forward march of racial and technological progress, and they advocated pursuing a policy of [[Indian Removal]].
