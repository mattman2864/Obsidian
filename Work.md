#Physics 
The work done on a [[System]] by a constant [[Force]] is defined to be the *product of the component of the force in the direction of motion and the distance through which the force acts*. For a constant force, this is expressed in equation form as
$$W=|F|(\cos{\theta})|d|$$
where $W$ is work, $d$ is the displacement of the system, and $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector $F$ and the displacement vector $d$. We can also write this as
$$W=Fd\cos\theta$$
To find the work done on a system that undergoes motion that is not one-way or that is in two or three dimensions, we divide the motion into one-way one-dimensional segments and add up the work done over each segment.
## Calculating Work
Work and [[Energy]] have the same units. From the definition of work, we see that those units are [[Force]] times distance. Thus, in SI units, work and energy are measured in **newton-meters**. A newton-meter is is given the special name **joule** ($J$), and $1J=1N\times m=1kg\times m^2/s^2$. One joule is not a large amount of energy; it would lift a small 100-gram apple a distance of about 1 meter.
