The work done on a system by a constant force is defined to be the *product of the component of the force in the direction of motion and the distance through which the force acts*. For a constant force, this is expressed in equation form as
$$W=|F|(\cos{\theta})|d|$$
where $W$ is work, $d$ is the displacement of the
