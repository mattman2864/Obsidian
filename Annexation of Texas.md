[[Texas]] was annexed by the United States in 1845 and became the 28th state. Until 1846, Texas had been part of Mexico, but in that year a group of settlers from the United States who lived in Mexican Texas declared independence. They called their new country the [[Republic of Texas]], which was an independent country for nine years. Politics in the United States fractured over the issue of whether Texas should be admitted as a slave or free state. In the end, Texas was admitted to the United States a slave state. The annexation of Texas contributed to the coming of the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846-1848). The conflict started, in part, over a disagreement about which river was Mexicoâ€™s true northern border: the [[Nueces]] or the [[Rio Grande]].
