#Physics 
Kinetic Energy is the [[energy]] an object has because of its motion. 

If we want to accelerate an object, then we must apply a [[force]]. Applying a force requires us to do [[work]]. After work has been done, [[energy]] has been transferred to the object, and the object will be moving with constant speed. The energy transferred is known as *kinetic energy*, and it depends on the [[mass]] and speed achieved.

Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.
