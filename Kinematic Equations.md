Assuming [[Acceleration]] is constant, [[kinematics]] can be described in these three equations:
$$d=v_it+\frac{at^2}{2}$$
$$v_f^2=v_i^2+2ad$$
$$v_f=v_i+at$$
$$d=t\frac{v_i+v_f}{2}$$
In these equations, the variables and SI units are given as:
- $v_x$ is the instantaneous velocity in the $x$-direction measured in $m/s$. If the motion is in the $y$ or $z$ direction, the subscript may be changed to $y$ or $z$.
- $v_{x0}$ is the initial velocity in the $x$-direction measured in $m/s$.
- $a_x$ is the acceleration in the direction of the motion in $m/s^2$.
- $x_0$ is the initial position in meters.
- $x$ is the position in meters.
- $t$ is the time in seconds.
If the acceleration is an unknown constant, this fourth equation can be helpful:
$$\Delta x=t(\frac{v+v_0}{2})$$
