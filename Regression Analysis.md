It can be difficult to see patterns or trends in lists of paired numbers. For this reason, we
sometimes begin by plotting the pairs (such a plot is called a **scatter plot**) to see whether
the corresponding points lie close to a curve of some kind. If they do, and if we can find an
equation $y = f( x )$ for the curve, then we have a formula that
1. summarizes the data with a simple expression, and
2. lets us predict values of $y$ for other values of $x$

The process of finding a curve to fit data is called **regression analysis** and the curve is called a **regression curve**.

There are many useful types of regression curves$-$power, exponential, logarithmic, sinusoidal, and so on.
