Charge is the [[Force]] that arises from electrical [[Current]]. A very noticeable thing about electric force is that it is large, far greater than the force of [[Gravity]]. Unlike gravity, however, there are two types of electric charge. Opposite types of charge attract, and like types of charge repel. Gravity has only one type: it only attracts, never repels.
