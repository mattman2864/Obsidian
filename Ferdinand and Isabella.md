Ferdinand II of [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and Isabella I of [[Castile]] were Spanish [[New Monarch]] during the 15th century. Married in 1469, they ruled during what is referred to as the "Golden Age of [[Spain]]". Because Castile was much larger and more powerful than Aragon, Isabella had much more power than Ferdinand and was responsible for many of the Spanish reforms during this period.

# [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]
Ferdinand and Isabella are also known as "The Catholic Monarchs" due to their extreme and often violent devotion to spreading [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. The most notable case of this is the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478.
