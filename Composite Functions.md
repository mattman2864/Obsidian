A function is composite if you can write it as $f(g(x))$. In other words, it is a function within a function, or a function of a function.

For example, $\cos(x^2)$ is composite, because if we let $f(x)=\cos(x)$ and $g(x)=x^2$, then $\cos(x^2)=f(g(x))$.

$g$ is the function within $f$, so we call $g$ the "inner" function and $f$ the "outer" function.
