A circuit is a collection of real components, power sources, and signal  sources, all connected so [[Current]] can flow in a complete circle.
## Closed Circuit
A circuit is *closed* if the circle is complete, if all currents have a path back to where they came from.
## Open Circuit
A circuit is *open* if the circle is not complete, if there is a gap or opening in the path.
## Short Circuit
A *short* happens when a path of low resistance is connected (usually by mistake) to a component. The resistor shown below is the intended path for current, and the curved wire going around it is the short. Current is diverted away from its  intended path, sometimes with damaging results. The wire *shorts out* the resistor by providing a low-resistance path for current (probably not what the designed intended).
## Make or Break
You *make* a circuit by closing the current path, such as when you close a switch. *Breaking* a circuit is the opposite. Opening a switch *breaks* the *circuit*
