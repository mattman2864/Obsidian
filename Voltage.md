Voltage is a unit used to measure the difference in electrical potential energy between two points. It is analogous to [[Gravity]] acting on a ball pushing it down a hill. We can express voltage between two points mathematically as the change of energy experienced by a charge:
$$V=\frac{\Delta U}{q}$$
